# SPAMClassification_ScikitSVM

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a discriminative model for classification. SVM is not a probabilistic algorithm. In other words, in its usual construction, it does not optimize a probability measure as a likelihood.SVM tries to find the best hyperplane that maximally separates the positive class from the negative class. 


An SVM classifier with linear kernel for spam classification using a python package named scikit-learn.
